# imf-codec

**Work in progress, do not use in production**
**This is currently only a decoder (parser), encoding is not supported.**

## Goals

- Maintainability - modifying the code does not create regression and is possible for someone exterior to the project. Keep cyclomatic complexity low.
- Composability - build your own parser by picking the relevant passes, avoid work that is not needed.
- Compatibility - always try to parse something, do not panic or return an error.
- Exhaustivity - serve as a common project to encode knowledge about emails (existing mime types, existing headers, etc.).

## Non goals

  - Parsing optimization that would make more complicated to understand the logic.
  - Optimization for a specific use case, to the detriment of other use cases.
  - Pipelining/streaming/buffering as the parser can arbitrarily backtrack + our result contains reference to the whole buffer, imf-codec must keep the whole buffer in memory. Avoiding the sequential approach would certainly speed-up a little bit the parsing, but it's too much work to implement currently.
  - Zerocopy. It might be implementable in the future, but to quickly bootstrap this project, I avoided it for now.

## Missing / known bugs

Current known limitations/bugs:

 - Resent Header Fields are not implemented
 - Return-Path/Received headers might be hard to use as their order is important, and it's currently lost in the final datastructure.
 - Datetime parsing of invalid date might return `None` instead of falling back to the `bad_body` field
 - Comments contained in the email headers are dropped during parsing
 - No support is provided for message/external-body (read data from local computer) and message/partial (aggregate multiple fragmented emails) as they seem obsolete and dangerous to implement.

## Design

Multipass design: each pass is in charge of a specific work.
*Having multiple pass does not necessarily lead to abyssmal performances.
For example, the [Chez Scheme compiler](https://legacy.cs.indiana.edu/~dyb/pubs/commercial-nanopass.pdf) 
pioneered the "Nanopass" concept and showcases excellent performances.*

Currently, you can use the following passes:
 - `segment.rs` - Extract the header section by finding the `CRLFCRLF` token.
 - `guess_charset.rs` - Find the header section encoding (should be ASCII or UTF8 but some corpus contains ISO-8859-1 headers)
 - `extract_fields.rs` - Extract the headers line by lines, taking into account Foldable White Space.
 - `field_lazy.rs` - Try to recognize the header fields (`From`, `To`, `Date`, etc.) but do not parse their value.  
 - `field_eager.rs` - Parse the value of each known header fields.  
 - `header_section.rs` - Aggregate the various fields in a single structure.  


## Testing strategy

imf-codec aims to be as much tested as possible against reald

### Unit testing: parser combinator independently (done)

### Selected full emails (expected)

### Existing datasets

**Enron 500k** - Took 20 minutes to parse ~517k emails and check that 
RFC5322 headers (From, To, Cc, etc.) are correctly parsed.
From this list, we had to exclude ~50 emails on which
the From/To/Cc fields were simply completely wrong, but while
some fields failed to parse, the parser did not crash and
parsed the other fields of the email correctly.

Run it on your machine:

```bash
cargo test -- --ignored --nocapture enron500k
```

Planned: jpbush, my inbox, etc.

### Fuzzing (expected)

### Across reference IMAP servers (dovevot, cyrus) (expected)

## Development status

Early development. Not ready.
Do not use it in production or any software at all.

Todo:
 - [X] test over the enron dataset
 - [X] convert to multipass parser
 - [X] fix warnings, put examples, refactor the code
 - [ ] implement mime part 3 (encoded headers)
 - [ ] implement mime part 1 (new headers)
 - [ ] review part 2 (media types) and part 4 (registration procedure) but might be out of scope
 - [ ] implement some targeted testing as part of mime part 5
 - [ ] implement fuzzing through cargo fuzz
 - [ ] test over other datasets (jpbush, ml, my inbox)
 - [ ] backport to aerogramme
