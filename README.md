# eml-codec

**‚ö†Ô∏è This is currently only a decoder (ie. a parser), encoding is not yet implemented.**

`eml-codec` is a child project of [Aerogramme](https://aerogramme.deuxfleurs.fr), a distributed and encrypted IMAP server developped by the non-profit organization [Deuxfleurs](https://deuxfleurs.fr).
Its aim is to be a swiss army knife to handle emails, whether it is to build an IMAP/JMAP server, a mail filter (like an antispam), or a mail client.

## Example

```rust
let input = br#"Date: 7 Mar 2023 08:00:00 +0200
From: deuxfleurs@example.com
To: someone_else@example.com
Subject: An RFC 822 formatted message
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

This is the plain text body of the message. Note the blank line
between the header information and the body of the message."#;

let email = eml_codec::email(input).unwrap();
println!(
    "{} just sent you an email with subject \"{}\"",
    email.imf.from[0].to_string(),
    email.imf.subject.unwrap().to_string(),
);
```

## About the name

This library does not aim at implementing a specific RFC, but to be a swiss-army knife to decode and encode ("codec") what is generaly considered an email (generally abbreviated "eml"), hence the name: **eml-codec**.

## Goals

- Maintainability - modifying the code does not create regression and is possible for someone exterior to the project.
- Compatibility - always try to parse something, do not panic or return an error.
- Exhaustivity - serve as a common project to encode knowledge about emails (existing mime types, existing headers, etc.).
- Type safe - do not manipulate only strings/bytes but leverage Rust type system instead so you benefit of its safety checks at compile time.

[See more about this library goals in the doc/ folder](./doc/goals.md)

## Missing / known bugs

Current known limitations/bugs:

 - Resent Header Fields are not implemented
 - Return-Path/Received headers might be hard to use as their order is important, and it's currently lost in the final datastructure.
 - Datetime parsing of invalid date might return `None` instead of falling back to the `bad_body` field
 - Comments contained in the email headers are dropped during parsing
 - No support is provided for message/external-body (read data from local computer) and message/partial (aggregate multiple fragmented emails) as they seem obsolete and dangerous to implement.

## Design

High-level overview of the datastructures (inspired by the UML class diagram conventions):

## Testing strategy

Currently this crate has some unit tests on most of its parsing functions.
It is also tested as part of Aerogramme, its parent project where it handles email parsing.
In this project,  `eml-codec` parsing capabilities are compared to Dovecot, Cyrus, Maddy and other IMAP servers.

It is planned to test it on large email datasets (like Enron, jpbush, mailing lists, etc.) but it's not done yet.
Fuzzing the library would also be interesting, probably to detect crashing due to stack overflow for example
due to the infinite recursivity of MIME.

## State of the art / alternatives

The following review is not an objective, neutral, impartial review. Instead, it's a temptative 
to explain why I wrote this library. If you find something outdated or objectively wrong, feel free to open a PR or an issue to fix it.
In no case, I think `eml-codec` is superior, it's just another approach to the problem, and I see it as another stone to the edifice.

[mail\_parser](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/mail-parser), [mailparse](https://github.com/staktrace/mailparse) and [rust-email](https://github.com/deltachat/rust-email) 
are 3 handwritten parsers. Such handwritten parsers do not encourage separation of concerns: `mail_parser` and `mailparse` feature large functions with hundreds of lines
with a high cylomatic complexity. Due to this complex logic, I have failed to debug/patch such code in the past. 
`rust-email` code is easier to read but its mime part implementation is marked as unstable. `mail_parser` is used in the IMAP/JMAP/SMTP server project [stalwartlabs/mail-server](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/mail-server) and `rust-email` is used in the email-based chat application [Deltachat](https://github.com/deltachat) (however `rust-email` MIME parsed is not used, a custom MIME parser is reimplemented in Delta Chat instead). It must be noted that `mail_parser` supports a large amount of extensions (UTF-8 headers, UTF-7 encoding, continuation, many custom fields, etc.) and would better cope with malformed emails than other libraries. **A goal of `eml_codec` is to be open to contribution and maintainable over time, which is made possible trough the parser combinator pattern that encourages writing small, reusable, independently testable functions.**

[rustyknife](https://github.com/jothan/rustyknife) is more targeted to SMTP servers (MTA) than IMAP (MDA) and email clients (MUA).
It thus only supports parsing headers and not emails' body. Also, an acquaintance warned me that this library is a bit slow,
it might be due to the fact that the library does some processing while parsing the email (like rebuilding and allocating strings).
If it happens that this part is not used later, the allocation/processing has been wasted.
**A goal of `eml_codec` is to produce an AST of the email with as few processing as possible, so that the parsing remains efficient,
and then the allocation/processing is made lazily, on demand, when the corresponding function is called. It is often referred as zero-copy.**
 
## Support

`eml-codec`, as part of the [Aerogramme project](https://nlnet.nl/project/Aerogramme/), was funded through the NGI Assure Fund, a fund established by NLnet with financial support from the European Commission's Next Generation Internet programme, under the aegis of DG Communications Networks, Content and Technology under grant agreement No 957073.
