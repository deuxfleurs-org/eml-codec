# eml-codec

**‚ö†Ô∏è This is currently only a decoder (ie. a parser), encoding is not yet implemented.**

`eml-codec` is a child project of [Aerogramme](https://aerogramme.deuxfleurs.fr), a distributed and encrypted IMAP server developped by the non-profit organization [Deuxfleurs](https://deuxfleurs.fr).
Its aim is to be a swiss army knife to handle emails, whether it is to build an IMAP/JMAP server, a mail filter (like an antispam), or a mail client.

## Example

```rust
let input = br#"Date: 7 Mar 2023 08:00:00 +0200
From: deuxfleurs@example.com
To: someone_else@example.com
Subject: An RFC 822 formatted message
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

This is the plain text body of the message. Note the blank line
between the header information and the body of the message."#;

let email = eml_codec::email(input).unwrap();
println!(
    "{} just sent you an email with subject \"{}\"",
    email.imf.from[0].to_string(),
    email.imf.subject.unwrap().to_string(),
);
```

## About the name

This library does not aim at implementing a specific RFC, but to be a swiss-army knife to decode and encode ("codec") what is generaly considered an email (generally abbreviated "eml"), hence the name: **eml-codec**.

## Goals

- Maintainability - modifying the code does not create regression and is possible for someone exterior to the project.
- Compatibility - always try to parse something, do not panic or return an error.
- Exhaustivity - serve as a common project to encode knowledge about emails (existing mime types, existing headers, etc.).

## Missing / known bugs

Current known limitations/bugs:

 - Resent Header Fields are not implemented
 - Return-Path/Received headers might be hard to use as their order is important, and it's currently lost in the final datastructure.
 - Datetime parsing of invalid date might return `None` instead of falling back to the `bad_body` field
 - Comments contained in the email headers are dropped during parsing
 - No support is provided for message/external-body (read data from local computer) and message/partial (aggregate multiple fragmented emails) as they seem obsolete and dangerous to implement.

## Design

High-level overview of the datastructures (inspired by the UML class diagram conventions):

## Testing strategy

Currently this crate has some unit tests on most of its parsing functions.
It is also tested as part of Aerogramme, its parent project where it handles email parsing.
In this project,  `eml-codec` parsing capabilities are compared to Dovecot, Cyrus, Maddy and other IMAP servers.

It is planned to test it on large email datasets (like Enron, jpbush, mailing lists, etc.) but it's not done yet.
Fuzzing the library would also be interesting, probably to detect crashing due to stack overflow for example
due to the infinite recursivity of MIME.
